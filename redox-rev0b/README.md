## Redox Keyboard Case From Scratch

I wanted to design a new case for the Redox that was inspired both
by the Redox Rev1 case and the Iris, and I thought it would be nice to
start with the layout from the [Keyboard Layout
Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) JSON file (in this way
it could be extended to other keyboards). Existing tools I had found for
going from KLE JSON to OpenSCAD didn't work for split keyboards where
some keys are rotated, so an updated tool is provided here that seems to
work on the split keyboards I have tried.
