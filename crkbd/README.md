## CRKBD keyboard Case From Scratch

This is a case for the
[Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard. It is a top plate
with tenting supports attached. The bottom plate could be 3D printed in
transparent plastic (or should be compatible with laser cut acrylic
bottom plate).

The top part has a couple of struts across where the OLED screen goes
that are purely to assist with keeping the edge attached during
printing, and these should be cut out after printing. The outermost
tenting mounts are raised compared to the inner ones, this is to allow
the outer sides to sit closer to the desk.

I've also designed a simple carrier that each half of the keyboard slots
into, and which has a wee compartment into which you can put the TRRS
cable and tenting legs during transport.
